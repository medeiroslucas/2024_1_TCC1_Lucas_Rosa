Planning project end to end use cases...

**********************************************
Based on the provided client brief and project specification, I'll design an AWS architecture using CDK with Python. The focus will be on creating a real-time chat application with minimal complexity while ensuring scalability and security.

**1. High-Level Architecture Overview**

The architecture will be divided into five main CDK stacks:

- **AuthenticationStack**
- **DatabaseStack**
- **APIStack**
- **WebSocketStack**
- **FrontendStack**

**Interactions:**
- Frontend application communicates with API Gateway REST endpoints for user management and WebSocket API for real-time chat
- WebSocket connections are managed through API Gateway and Lambda
- DynamoDB stores user data and chat messages
- Cognito handles user authentication

**Justification:**
This architecture is optimized for real-time communication while maintaining simplicity and cost-effectiveness. It uses serverless components to minimize operational overhead and provides easy scaling.

**2. Detailed CDK Stack Descriptions**

**AuthenticationStack**

- **Purpose:** Manage user authentication and authorization
- **AWS Resources:**
  - Amazon Cognito User Pool
    - Username-based sign-up
    - Custom attributes for user profile
  - Cognito App Client
    - Configured for web application
  - IAM Roles for Cognito
- **Interactions:**
  - Provides authentication tokens for API access
  - Integrates with API Gateway authorizers
- **Rationale:**
  - Simple username-based authentication as per requirements
  - Managed service reducing security implementation complexity

**DatabaseStack**

- **Purpose:** Store user data and chat messages
- **AWS Resources:**
  - DynamoDB Tables:
    - Users Table (username as partition key)
    - Messages Table (composite key: chatId + timestamp)
    - ChatSessions Table (manages active chats)
  - IAM Roles for DynamoDB access
- **Interactions:**
  - Accessed by Lambda functions for data operations
- **Rationale:**
  - NoSQL design optimal for chat applications
  - Flexible schema for future feature additions

**APIStack**

- **Purpose:** Handle HTTP API requests for user operations
- **AWS Resources:**
  - API Gateway REST API
  - Lambda Functions:
    - User search
    - Profile management
    - Chat history retrieval
  - IAM Roles for Lambda
  - Cognito Authorizers
- **Interactions:**
  - Uses Cognito for request authorization
  - Queries DynamoDB for user data
- **Rationale:**
  - REST API for non-real-time operations
  - Serverless architecture for cost-effectiveness

**WebSocketStack**

- **Purpose:** Manage real-time chat communications
- **AWS Resources:**
  - API Gateway WebSocket API
  - Lambda Functions:
    - Connection handler
    - Message handler

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a basic chat application while allowing for future enhancements. The use of serverless components ensures low operational overhead and good scalability. The separation into distinct stacks makes the system maintainable and allows for independent updates of different components.

----------------------------------------------
I'll break down the main use cases and describe the end-to-end workflows, showing how data flows through the AWS services.

**Main Use Cases Workflows:**

**1. User Registration**
```
Flow:
Frontend → API Gateway → Lambda → Cognito → DynamoDB

1. User enters username and password in frontend
2. Frontend calls API Gateway registration endpoint
3. Lambda function:
   - Validates username availability
   - Creates user in Cognito User Pool
   - Creates user record in DynamoDB Users table with schema:
     {
       username: String (partition key),
       createdAt: Timestamp,
       status: String (online/offline)
     }
4. Returns success/error to frontend
```

**2. User Login**
```
Flow:
Frontend → Cognito → Frontend → WebSocket API

1. User enters credentials in frontend
2. Cognito authenticates and returns JWT tokens
3. Frontend:
   - Stores tokens in local storage
   - Establishes WebSocket connection with connection ID
4. WebSocket Lambda:
   - Updates user status to 'online' in DynamoDB
   - Stores connection ID mapping:
     {
       connectionId: String (partition key),
       username: String,
       lastActive: Timestamp
     }
```

**3. Search Users**
```
Flow:
Frontend → API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB → Frontend

1. User types username in search box
2. Frontend calls API Gateway search endpoint with:
   {
     "searchTerm": "username_pattern"
   }
3. Lambda function:
   - Queries DynamoDB Users table using begins_with or contains
   - Returns matching users:
     {
       "users": [
         {
           "username": "user1",
           "status": "online"
         },
         ...
       ]
     }
4. Frontend displays results
```

**4. Start Chat**
```
Flow:
Frontend → API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB → WebSocket

1. User selects target user from search results
2. Frontend calls API Gateway chat creation endpoint:
   {
     "targetUser": "username"
   }
3. Lambda function:
   - Creates chat session in ChatSessions table:
     {
       chatId: UUID (partition key),
       participants: [initiator_username, target_username],
       createdAt: Timestamp,
       lastMessage: Timestamp
     }
   - Returns chatId to frontend
4. Frontend switches to chat view
```

**5. Send Message**
```
Flow:
Frontend → WebSocket API → Lambda → DynamoDB → WebSocket → Recipients

1. User sends message through WebSocket:
   {
     "action": "sendMessage",
     "chatId": "uuid",
     "content": "message text"
   }
2. WebSocket Lambda:
   - Stores message in Messages table:
     {
       chatId: String (partition key),
       timestamp: Number (sort key),
       sender: String,
       content: String
     }
   - Retrieves recipient's connection ID
   - Sends message to recipient through WebSocket API
3. Recipient's frontend receives and displays message
```

**6. Load Chat History**
```
Flow:
Frontend → API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB → Frontend

1. Frontend requests chat history:
   {
     "chatId": "uuid",
     "limit": 50,
     "beforeTimestamp": optional_timestamp
   }
2. Lambda function:
   - Queries Messages table using chatId and timestamp
   - Returns paginated results:
     {
       "messages": [
         {
           "sender": "username",
           "content": "message",
           "timestamp": 1234567890
         },
         ...
       ],
       "nextToken": optional_pagination_token
     }
3. Frontend displays messages
```

**Data Storage Patterns:**

**DynamoDB Tables Design:**

1. **Users Table:**
```json
{
  "username": "string (partition key)",
  "status": "string",
  "lastActive": "number",
  "createdAt": "number"
}
```

2. **ChatSessions Table:**
```json
{
  "chatId": "string (partition key)",
  "participants": "string[]",
  "createdAt": "number",
  "lastMessage": "number"
}
```

3. **Messages Table:**
```json
{
  "chatId": "string (partition key)",
  "timestamp": "number (sort key)",
  "sender": "string",
  "content": "string"
}
```

4. **Connections Table:**
```json
{
  "connectionId": "string (partition key)",
  "username": "string",
  "lastActive": "number"
}
```

**Real-time Updates:**

1. **Message Delivery:**
- Messages are stored in DynamoDB
- DynamoDB Streams trigger Lambda
- Lambda pushes to connected WebSocket clients

2. **Online Status:**
- WebSocket connections/disconnections update user status
- Status changes are broadcast to relevant users

**Error Handling:**

1. **Message Delivery Failures:**
- Messages marked as 'pending' in UI until confirmed
- Retry logic for failed WebSocket deliveries
- Offline message queueing in DynamoDB

2. **Connection Issues:**
- Automatic reconnection attempts by frontend
- Session recovery using last received message timestamp

**Scaling Considerations:**

1. **DynamoDB:**
- Partition key design supports even distribution
- Auto-scaling based on read/write capacity

2. **WebSocket Connections:**
- API Gateway handles connection scaling
- Connection cleanup for inactive sessions

This workflow design provides:
- Real-time message delivery
- Efficient data storage and retrieval
- Scalable connection management
- Reliable message history
- Simple user discovery
- Proper error handling and recovery

The architecture can be extended to support additional features like:
- Message read receipts
- Typing indicators
- File attachments
- Group chats
- Message reactions

Each enhancement would build upon this basic structure while maintaining the serverless, event-driven nature of the system.
