----------------------------------------------
I'll break down the main use cases and their end-to-end workflows through the AWS architecture.

**1. Creator Starting a Live Stream**

Workflow:
1. **Authentication:**
   - Creator logs in through web interface
   - Cognito authenticates and provides JWT tokens
   - Application Stack validates tokens and permissions

2. **Stream Setup:**
   ```
   Web App → API Gateway → Lambda → IVS
   ```
   - Lambda generates unique stream key from IVS
   - Stream details stored in DynamoDB
   - Stream metadata published to EventBridge

3. **Stream Start:**
   ```
   Creator's OBS/Software → IVS Ingest → IVS Processing
   ```
   - IVS receives RTMP stream

Data Flow:
```json
// Viewer Session (DynamoDB)
{
    "sessionId": "sess_789",
    "userId": "viewer_101",
    "streamId": "str_123",
    "joinTime": "2024-01-20T15:05:00Z",
    "quality": "1080p",
    "deviceType": "desktop",
    "location": "US-East"
}
```

**3. Live Chat Interaction**

Workflow:
1. **Message Sending:**
   ```
   Web App → WebSocket API → Lambda → ElastiCache/DynamoDB
   ```
   - WebSocket connection maintained
   - Messages validated and filtered
   - Stored temporarily in ElastiCache
   - Archived in DynamoDB

2. **Message Broadcasting:**
   ```
   Lambda → WebSocket API → Connected Viewers
   ```
   - Messages fan out to all stream viewers
   - Rate limiting applied
   - Moderation rules enforced

Data Flow:
```json
// Chat Message (ElastiCache/DynamoDB)
{
    "messageId": "msg_456",
    "streamId": "str_123",
    "userId": "viewer_101",
    "content": "Great stream!",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-20T15:10:00Z",
    "type": "text"
}
```

**4. Stream Analytics and Monitoring**

Workflow:
1. **Real-time Metrics:**
   ```
   IVS → CloudWatch → Lambda → DynamoDB
   ```
   - Concurrent viewers
   - Stream health
   - Network performance

2. **Alert Handling:**
   ```
   CloudWatch → EventBridge → SNS → Lambda
   ```
   - Threshold monitoring
   - Automatic notifications
   - Issue remediation

Data Flow:
```json
// Stream Metrics (CloudWatch)
{
    "streamId": "str_123",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-20T15:15:00Z",
    "metrics": {
        "concurrentViewers": 1000,
        "bitrate": 4500,
        "frameRate": 60,
        "healthScore": 98
    }
}
```

**5. Content Moderation**

Workflow:
1. **Chat Moderation:**
   ```
   WebSocket → Lambda → Comprehend → Lambda → WebSocket
   ```
   - Real-time text analysis
   - Automated filtering
   - Moderator alerts

2. **Stream Content:**
   ```
   IVS → Rekognition → Lambda → EventBridge
   ```
   - Content analysis
   - Policy enforcement
   - Automated actions

Data Flow:
```json
// Moderation Action (DynamoDB)
{
    "actionId": "mod_789",
    "streamId": "str_123",
    "type": "chat_filter",
    "reason": "inappropriate_content",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-20T15:20:00Z",
    "action": "message_blocked"
}
```

**Key Performance Considerations:**

1. **Latency Management:**
   - CloudFront edge locations minimize delivery latency
   - WebSocket connections maintain real-time chat
   - ElastiCache provides sub-millisecond data access

2. **Scaling:**
   - Auto-scaling groups for Lambda functions
   - DynamoDB on-demand capacity
   - IVS automatic scaling for viewer count

3. **Data Persistence:**
   - Hot data in ElastiCache
   - Warm data in DynamoDB
   - Cold data archived to S3

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Automatic failover for critical services
   - Retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Dead letter queues for failed operations

This workflow design ensures:
- Minimal latency for live streaming
- Real-time interaction capabilities
- Scalable chat functionality
- Robust monitoring and moderation
- Efficient data management across services
