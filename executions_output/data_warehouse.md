  - The data warehouse must also integrate with NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).

**3. Functional Requirements**

**3.1 Data Extraction**

- **Periodic Data Querying:**
  - The system will perform scheduled data extraction from all connected databases.
  - Support for incremental data extraction to capture only new or modified data since the last extraction.

- **Data Type Agnosticism:**
  - The system must handle various data types from both relational and NoSQL sources without the need for manual configuration.

**3.2 Data Transformation**

- **Data Standardization:**
  - Transform data into a consistent format suitable for storage in the data warehouse.
  - Handle data type conversions and resolve discrepancies between data types across sources.

- **Data Cleansing:**
  - Implement data cleansing procedures to correct or remove inaccurate records.

**3.3 Data Loading**

- **Unified Data Storage:**
  - Load transformed data into the data warehouse, maintaining data integrity and consistency.
  - Support for both batch and real-time data loading processes.

- **Scalability:**
  - The system must be scalable to accommodate increasing data volumes as the company grows.

**3.4 Data Access and Analysis**

- **Data Querying and Reporting:**
  - Enable users to perform complex queries and generate reports from the centralized data warehouse.
  - Integration with business intelligence (BI) tools for data visualization and analysis.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Provide a user-friendly interface for non-technical users to access and analyze data.

**4. User Roles**

- **Data Analyst:**
  - Access to query and analyze data, generate reports, and visualize data trends.

- **Data Engineer:**
  - Manage data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
  - Oversee data integration and ensure data quality within the warehouse.

- **Administrator:**
  - Administer user access and permissions.
  - Monitor system performance and manage data security.

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Performance:**
  - Ensure efficient data processing to minimize ETL cycle times.

- **Security:**
  - Implementation of robust security measures to protect sensitive data.
  - Data encryption both in transit and at rest.

- **Compliance:**
  - Adherence to relevant data protection regulations and compliance standards.

**6. Assumptions**

- The company will provide necessary access credentials for all databases.
- Users have access to business intelligence tools for data analysis.

**7. Constraints**

- Integration with databases must not disrupt existing operations.
- Data extraction frequency will be based on company requirements and database capabilities.

This requirements specification outlines the centralization of company data through a data warehouse solution, enhancing data analysis capabilities while remaining agnostic to data types and database systems.
