  - Define two Amazon DynamoDB tables: `UsersTable` and `ChatsTable`.
    - **UsersTable:** Include attributes such as `username` (primary key), `displayName`, `avatarUrl`, `statusMessage`, and `privacySettings`.
    - **ChatsTable:** Include attributes like `chatId` (primary key), `senderId`, `recipientId`, `timestamp`, and `messageContent`.
  - Configure appropriate primary keys and secondary indexes to optimize query performance for user searches and chat retrievals.
  - Enable DynamoDB Streams on the ChatsTable if real-time processing of chat messages is required.
  - Set provisioned or on-demand capacity based on expected usage patterns to ensure scalability.

**Task 6: Implement Access Permissions for DynamoDB Tables**

- **Description:**
  - Within the `DatabaseStack`, define IAM roles and policies that grant the Backend Application Stack necessary permissions to interact with the DynamoDB tables.
  - Ensure that Lambda functions accessing DynamoDB have the least privilege required to perform their operations.
  - Attach policies that allow actions such as `GetItem`, `PutItem`, `Query`, and `Scan` on the UsersTable and ChatsTable as needed.
  - Verify that no overly permissive policies are granted, maintaining a strong security posture.
  - Document the IAM roles and their associated permissions for future maintenance and auditing.

#### **4. Backend Application Stack**

**Task 7: Develop Lambda Functions for Authentication and User Management**

    - **RegisterUserFunction:** Handles user sign-up requests, interacting with Amazon Cognito to create new users.
    - **LoginUserFunction:** Manages user authentication, validating credentials and issuing tokens via Cognito.
    - **LogoutUserFunction:** Facilitates user logout by revoking tokens or clearing sessions.
    - **ManageProfileFunction:** Allows users to view and update their profile information, interacting with the UsersTable in DynamoDB.
  - Ensure each Lambda function is written in Python, following best coding practices and standards.
  - Configure environment variables and necessary IAM permissions for each Lambda function to access Cognito and DynamoDB resources securely.

**Task 8: Set Up API Gateway Endpoints for Backend APIs**

- **Description:**
  - Within the `BackendApplicationStack`, configure Amazon API Gateway to expose RESTful endpoints for frontend interaction.
  - Define endpoints such as `/register`, `/login`, `/logout`, `/profile`, and `/search`.
  - Integrate each endpoint with the corresponding Lambda functions developed in Task 7.
  - Configure request and response mappings, ensuring that API Gateway correctly transforms data between the frontend and Lambda functions.
  - Enable CORS settings to allow the frontend application to communicate with the API securely.
  - Implement throttling and rate limiting to protect backend services from abuse and ensure fair usage.

#### **5. Real-Time Communication Stack**

**Task 9: Configure WebSocket API for Real-Time Messaging**

- **Description:**
  - In the `real_time_communication_stack.py` file, create a new CDK stack class named `RealTimeCommunicationStack`.
  - Set up an Amazon API Gateway WebSocket API to facilitate real-time, two-way communication between clients and the backend.
  - Define WebSocket routes such as `$connect`, `$disconnect`, and custom `$message` routes to handle different message types.
  - Integrate each route with corresponding Lambda functions responsible for managing connections and message routing.
  - Enable usage plans and throttling settings to ensure the WebSocket API can scale with user demand while maintaining performance.

**Task 10: Develop Lambda Functions for WebSocket Connection and Messaging**

- **Description:**
  - Within the `RealTimeCommunicationStack`, implement AWS Lambda functions to handle WebSocket events.
    - **ConnectHandlerFunction:** Manages new WebSocket connections, storing connection IDs and associating them with user identities in DynamoDB.
