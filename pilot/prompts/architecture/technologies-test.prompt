You're designing the architecture and technical specifications for a new project that will be entirely hosted on AWS and can use all available AWS services. The architecture you create will be implemented using AWS CDK and python, so create the
architecture thinking in CDK stacks, each stack must contain a logic group of the application, and not be based on use cases.

Here are the details for the new project:
-----------------------------
---CLIENT-BRIEF-START---
{{ project_description }}
---CLIENT-BRIEF-END---

Here is the specification your team came up with:
---SPEC-START---
{{ project_specs }}
---SPEC-END---
-----------------------------

Based on these details, think step by step to design the architecture for the project and choose AWS services to use in building it.

1. First, design and describe project architecture in general terms, displaying all CDK stacks you intend to use and how they will interact with each other and why it is the best option in this case.
2. Then, list all the CDK stacks you plain to use. For each CDK stack, output a a brief description of how the stack will be used to implement the project specs and what are the AWS resources you will use on this stack.
A AWS service must preferably be used by only one stack
